# Fundamentals of Acoustics project

Experimentally derive the relationship between speed of sound in the air and temperature

### Hardware needed

- Arduino UNO (or any other board)
- Ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04 or similar
- Temperature and humidity sensor HTU21d or similar
- jumper wires and a breadboard
- USB cable

### Software needed

- Arduino IDE
- Processing 3
- Python3 (dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, jupiter-notebook)

### Files

- `project.ino`: to load on your board
- `logger.pde`: to serial read data from the board and write in a txt file
- `data0.csv`: data ready csv
- `analysis.ipynb`: jupyter notebook containing python code
- `analysis - Jupyter Notebook.htm`: screenshot of notebook (static) with relative files folder
